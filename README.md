# Nikos Mavridis â€“ Personal Website (ReactÂ +Â Vite)

This repo contains the source code for my personal website, rebuilt with **ReactÂ 18** and **Vite**. The site started life as a singleâ€‘page vanillaâ€‘HTML project; migrating to ViteÂ +Â React gives me reusable components, lightningâ€‘fast HMR during development, and a oneâ€‘click GitHubÂ Pages deploy.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev           # Vite dev server with Hotâ€‘ModuleÂ Reload
```

## Production build & preview

```bash
npm run build         # outputs static files to /dist
npm run preview       # serves the production build locally
```

## Continuous deployment

A GitHubÂ Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) builds the site and publishes `dist/` to **GitHubÂ Pages** on every push to `main`.
